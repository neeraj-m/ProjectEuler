##Problem 145
https://projecteuler.net/problem=145

Some positive integers n have the property that the sum of [n + reverse(n)] consists entirely of odd digits.

For example: When n = 36 then 36 + 63 = 99 When n = 409 then 409 + 904 = 1313 We will call such numbers reversible; so 36, 63, 409, and 904 are reversible.

Leading zeros are not allowed in either n or reverse(n).

For instance:
10 + 01 is ignored and 10 is not

There are 120 reversible numbers below one-thousand.

1. Develop a solution using best practices that can take any integer as an upper limit and return all the reversible numbers from 1 to the upper limit, as an array.

2. How many reversible numbers are there below one-billion (109)?
